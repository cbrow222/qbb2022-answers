#QBB2022 - Day 4 - Homework Exercises Submission
A:
1. 0.55 is the start value, 1.05 is the end value, 0.05 is the increment size
The resulting array runs from 0.55 to 1.05 incremented by 0.05 with a varying number of decimal points
2. numpy.around takes a decimal value and rounds it to a given number of decimal points, in this case 2 
The resulting array has the same values as the above one.
3. The array has switched order so now it is in decsending order.

C:
As you increase the propability of getting a head increases, the power increases. As the number of tosses increases, the power increases.

D:
The paper discusses the biological phenomenon of transmission distortion in humans.
Some alleles found in nature have been discribed to transmit with greater frequency than the 0.5 that is predicted by Mendel's Law of segregation.

In both cases as you increase along the x and y axes, the power increases. The scales for both axes are different between the graphs changing exactly how the pattern appears. 
Transmission rate corresponds to probability of a head.
Number of sperm corresponds to number of tosses.

A binomial distribution discribes the likelyhood of getting a given outcome or one more severe, farther from the expected value, when faced with a bianary choice. Both simulations are dealing with a bianary choice. In the coin toss, you have heads or tails. In the paper, you have inheriting the allele or not.

# Exercise 1

The code looks good

# Exercise 2

Great plots!

Please include the code that you used for exercise 2. 

Also, the results of the statistical tests (sizes from OLS) are not in line with my expectations for the slope coefficient.

I would recommend reporting p-values in addition to commenting on whether a test showed significance.

Finally, the predicted number of DNMs for the final problem also doesn't match with expectations.

Happy to help troubleshoot but will need code for this.

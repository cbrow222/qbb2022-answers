# Feedback day1 homework

This was a really well done assignment. Your explanations were clear, your code was included, and all of your answers were correct. I especially appreciate the care you took writing you scripts, including the shebang, usage statement, and other formatting choice to make them readable. Well done and keep up the good work!

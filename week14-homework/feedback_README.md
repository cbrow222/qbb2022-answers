Great work! Just a few small things:

1. When calculating the portion of the assembly each bin represents, we meant what portion of the total assembly, not just the bit of the assembly represented by the bins (no points deducted)
2. For Question 3C, just because they're inconsistent doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong... bacterial genomes can be very different sizes. How would we go about actually calculating the length (in bp) of each bin? (-1 point)
I really like your implementation for Step 3, I think you might just have a `' '.join()` command somewhere that is adding spaces between the characters of the taxonomy

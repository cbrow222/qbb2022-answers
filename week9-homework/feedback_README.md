Excellent work! Just one very small comment:
1. When you're comparing your lists of significant transcripts, I think you accidently copied your code for finding significant transcripts from the first model, without changing the variable names, so you end up comparing model 1 to itself (thus why your overlap is 100%). I ran your code with the correct variable names though, so don't worry about it (no points deducted)

Great job!

1. The biggest difference I see is that my dCTCF plots are black. (Which may just be an error in my code.) I do not know what difference you are trying to highlight.
2. Increasing sequencing depth improved the plot quality and made it more smooth (fewer random points that don't seem to match the general theme.)
3. What highlighted signal? I don't see anything highlighted in my data. If you are referring to the boxed region shown in the paper figure, that is a region that has different interactions in the ddCTCF and dCTCF conditions.

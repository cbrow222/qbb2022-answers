## Feedback for day1-lunch from KW

### Exercise 2

* b (Mean): Great!

* c (Median): Yep, ideally, you'd want a 4th column in the exon bed file that you have that records what gene the exon is found in already. Then you could use `cut`, `sort`, `uniq -c` to get those number of exons per gene.

### Exercise 3

* b (Tally): Nice. Like how you discussed how to get the proper numeric order as well! much more visually pleasing to look at the output

* c (Fraction): Fantastic

### Exercise 4

* b (Tally): Very good

* c (All super populations): Very nice.

### Exercise 5

* b (HG00100.vcf): Good work!

* c (genotypes): Fantastic!

* d (AF): good

* e (AFR_AF): Could you `grep` it instead?
